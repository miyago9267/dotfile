# coralline — a configurable, Powerlevel10k-inspired statusline for Claude Code
# https://github.com/Nanako0129/coralline
# Visual style is a tribute to https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k
#
# Design goals:
#   * Minimal process spawning per render — helpers return via globals
#     (printf -v) instead of $(...) subshells, so it stays cheap even under
#     Git Bash on Windows, where fork() is emulated and expensive.
#   * One jq call, one git call. Pure bash arithmetic (no bc). Exception, opt-in:
#     with `toks` or `ttft` listed, the render that closes a response (and at most
#     two retries while the transcript catches up) adds one tail and one jq.
#   * Works on macOS bash 3.2 and Linux/Windows (Git Bash) bash 4+/5.
#   * Everything themeable via ~/.claude/coralline.conf (sourced bash)
#
# Requires: jq, and a Nerd Font terminal unless VL_ASCII=1

# --subagent: speak Claude Code's subagentStatusLine protocol instead — one
# {"id","content"} JSON line per agent-panel row (see the branch after the
# render helpers). Everything else (config, theme, helpers) is shared.
SUBAGENT_MODE=0
[ "${1:-}" = "--subagent" ] && SUBAGENT_MODE=1

# -d '' reads until NUL (i.e. all of stdin, like cat) without forking.
# -t 5 prevents zombie bash on MSYS2 where pipe EOF may never arrive.

# window shows a stale one. With this on, every render records its 5h/7d
# (reset, pct) to a small per-host store, and a session that has no valid reading
# of its own — no rate_limits in the payload, or a window that has already
# elapsed — displays the newest window any session recorded. A session WITH a
# valid reading always shows its own: the percentage can legitimately fall inside
# one window (upstream reset, plan upgrade) and no other session's snapshot is
# better evidence about it. It cannot refresh a session that is not redrawing at
# all (that is a Claude Code limit).

#     background, which no palette can predict
#   * lean/classic paint the row on the uniform bar rather than the pill, so a bar
#     the candidates were not tuned for disqualifies them; in pill style the bar
#     is inert and is not consulted, so a leftover VL_BG_BAR cannot disable this
#   * VL_LEAN_FG forces the row's text colour, and that request outranks a
#     status ink resolved here (the lean block below assigns it to VL_FG_TEXT)
#   * an explicit VL_BG_SUB_NAME is a ground of the user's choosing, so the inks

# Per-(second, window, pct) burn-write election. N concurrent sessions on one
# account share one current 5h window and would otherwise each append a
# near-identical row every second, keeping the file permanently past BURN_TRIM
# so that every render pays a whole-file rewrite; measured at n=16 that write
# path alone is ~600ms CPU/s aggregate. The reader keeps only the MAX pct per
# (reset, sample) row (add_obs), so a reading at or below a pct already
# claimed for this (second, window) is exactly the row dedup would discard: a
# session appends only when it carries new information. Same-pct sessions (the
# storm case) collapse to one writer; a session with a HIGHER reading — e.g.
# the one actively burning while another idles on a stale snapshot — always
# still lands, and a session on a DIFFERENT window claims a different token,
# so the persisted series is exactly what every-session writes produce.
# Limit-store publishing (rl_sample) is deliberately NOT elected: those
# entries are idempotent bounded mkdirs with no rewrite cost, and any session
# may hold a newer window that must be able to reach the store.
# Tokens live beside the burn file and carry its name as prefix
# (<burnfile>.<epoch>.<reset>.<pctmilli>.tick), mirroring burn_tmp_sweep's
# provenance rule: in a shared parent directory only files that name THIS
# store are ever considered ours, so the sweep cannot touch foreign files.
# The claim is a noclobber `:` redirect (O_CREAT|O_EXCL, no fork). Losing, and
# every guard failure around the claim, leaves the store untouched; only a
# claim that fails while the token is genuinely absent (e.g. parent not yet
# created) fails OPEN to today's every-session-writes behavior, because the
# mutations downstream re-run their own TOCTOU guards and a fresh store must

# A killed render leaves its trim temporary behind: awk writes <base>.<pid>.tmp in
# full and the mv that would have consumed it never runs. Nothing ever retired
# those, so one busy host accumulated 1012 of them (38 MB) in three days. Sweep on
# the mutating path only, and without a fork per file: the name must be exactly
# <base>.<digits>.tmp, the object a regular non-symlink file, and older than the
# store it was derived from — a temporary a live render is still writing is never
# older than the base it is about to replace. Losing that race costs one trim (mv
# finds no file, the base stays intact), never data. One batched rm, capped so a
# pathological directory cannot build an unbounded argument list; what is left
# over is swept by the next render.
# The glob is eager: bash expands and sorts every match before the loop runs, so
# the cap bounds deletions and stat calls but not the expansion. That is accepted
# rather than fixed, because bash has no fork-free lazy directory walk and find is
# barred from the state path by both the fork budget and a regression test. The
# cost was measured on the real backlog that motivated this: a clean store is
# indistinguishable from bare interpreter startup (24 ms either way), and 1020
# orphans cost 137 ms on the worst render and drain in nine, after which they
# cannot come back, since 128 per render outruns accumulation by three orders of
# magnitude (about 48 per hour observed). Raising the cap to drain in one render
# is worse, not better: 1024 per pass measured 4385 ms, well past the one-second

# Claude Code re-renders an idle session from its last-seen snapshot, so the
# moment a window elapses with no interaction BOTH sources fall invalid in the
# same render and gating the segment on validity blanked it until the next
# keystroke delivered a fresh snapshot. Fall back to the ELAPSED window's last
# reading instead, which needs both halves of the snapshot to have survived
# validation: _CUR*_PCT means the pct passed state_pct, and a _CUR*_RST inside
# (0, NOW] means state_payload_epoch parsed a reset that has since passed. A
# missing or malformed reset leaves _CUR*_RST at 0 and must NOT render, or the
# bar would claim an elapsed window that was never observed; a reset beyond the
# window ceiling is the corrupt/sentinel snapshot rejected in #32 and must not
# render a countdown days or years out. seg_limit shows an elapsed reset as
# "now", which is what v0.11 displayed here.
# The fallback is for a window that JUST elapsed, so it is bounded by the same
# ceiling that validates a future reset. Claude Code keeps replaying the last
# snapshot an idle session ever received: observed here were sessions still
# reporting 41% for a window that closed 27 hours earlier and 55% for one that
# closed three days earlier. Rendering those as the current window is worse than
# rendering nothing, and past the bound the segment falls through to the store,
# which by construction only holds windows that are still open.

# last job — "the sole source whenever this session has no valid reading at all".
# The payload carries rate_limits only once the session has received an API
# response, so a freshly started, resumed, or idle session has no reading of its
# own and blanked both gauges even though the account-level window was known.
# Borrowing then is safe in a way it was not before #61/#62: rl_latest admits an
# entry only while its reset is still ahead of NOW, and garbage-collects every
# entry it outranks, so there is no fossil to inherit. What is still borrowed is
# the highest percentage recorded for the CURRENT window by any session, which is
# an over-estimate when sessions disagree; that is the accepted cost of showing
# the account's window instead of nothing. The store carries no account identity
# and the payload offers nothing to derive one from, so switching Claude accounts
# under one OS account can show the previous account's still-open window until the
# new one's first response lands. That is the same interval in which the gauge used
# to show nothing at all, and it ends as soon as this session has its own reading.

# ── Runtime detection (node / python segments) ───────────────────────────────
# Each sets the global _RT to a label for directory $1 (empty when nothing is
# detected), so the seg_* callers read a global instead of a $() subshell — the
# fork-free convention used by fg/_FG, trunc/_TR, seg_len/SEG_LEN_R.
#
# The pin-file path (.nvmrc / .python-version, walking up ancestors) is always
# tried first and never forks. The interpreter probe DOES fork, so it is gated
# behind VL_RUNTIME_PROBE, off by default (set it to 1 to detect e.g. nvm's
# active version in a repo with no pin file).

# Notes: `read` returns non-zero at EOF on a newline-less pin file, but $v IS
# set — so pre-clear and ignore read's status rather than `|| v=""`, which would
# discard the value. `[ -f ]` (not `[ -r ]`) so a directory named .nvmrc does
# not match and make `read` emit "Is a directory". The walk uses `case */*` to
