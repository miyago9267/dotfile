# Regression for the segment-glyph knobs (#47): VL_CTX_GLYPH, VL_PROJECT_GLYPH,
# and the gauge pair VL_BAR_FILL / VL_BAR_EMPTY.
#
# Why they exist: ⬡ U+2B21, ⬢ U+2B22 and ▱ U+25B1 are plain Unicode, not Nerd
# Font PUA icons, so Nerd Fonts never patches them in — a font that lacks them
# hands substitution to the terminal's own fallback, which can draw wider than
# one cell and shove the whole row out of alignment. (Measured: ▱ is absent from
# JetBrainsMono Nerd Font and falls back to Hiragino Sans W3 at 1.67 cell.) The
# knobs let a user swap in a glyph their font actually carries.
#
# These checks pin both directions: an override must reach the render, and the
# shipped defaults must not move — the fix is opt-in, so a default render still
# has to emit ⬡ / ⬢ / ▰ / ▱.
#
#   bash test/test-glyph.sh
#
# Needs jq (statusline.sh parses JSON, and the payload cwd is rewritten with it)
# and test/sample-input.json.
